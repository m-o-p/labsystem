If you put the phpMarkdown [extra] (http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) script here, you can use MarkDown syntax for your authoring.
The tag to do so is [MD] then, like:

[MD]
# This is an H1 #

## This is an H2 ##

### This is an H3 ######

See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax for Syntax

[Gets invoked by /include/helper.inc:parseHTML()]
