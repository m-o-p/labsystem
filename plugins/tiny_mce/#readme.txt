To enable WYSIWYG functionality place TinyMCE here.


Download TinyMCE.

Copy it to the subdirectory "tiny_mce" of your labsystem root directory (here).

From now on you can enable WYSIWYG-editing by adding &tinyMCE in the url (it will be preserved for links inside the system, so you have to enter it only once).

Background:
The feature is enabled in the "/include/page_layout.inc". There you can also enable it permanently or customize the path to your tinyMCE installation.
