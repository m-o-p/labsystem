* Defines the constants for the user roles.
* These constants are essential for the user rights.
*
* If you change the constants here you have to change tham
* everywhere where they are used:
*    - elements visibility rights
*    - user rights
*    - config file default values
*    - menu
*
* Adding further user roles does not cause troubles where the
* numeric constant is not defined as the query returns false then.
* Duplicate different meanings (e.g. 1024 = A in system alpha and
* 1024 = B in system beta will cause trouble as the system works
* only on the numerical constants!
*/

/* All values in here are shown as setable properties on the user rights page.
 * If you want to have less values use another roles file.
 * see user_roles and user_roles_useradmin for an example.
 * Restrictions:
 * -------------------------------------
 *    1 | someone who authenticated
 *    2 | is able to set the userrights
 *    4 | is able to edit pages
 *    8 | user will be available as mail supporter from the email-menu
 *   16 | user will be able to send to all IS_MAIL_RECEIVER and not only to IS_MAIL_SUPPORTER
 *   32 | user is available as mail receiver from within the system
 *   64 | is able to make schedules
 *  128 | is able to correct the closed labs
 *  256 | is able to view the example solutions

/*                         Is used on iterations (p.e. 0..MAX_USER_ROLE).

  Since these are bit-values you can use the bit operators:
      IS_USER_RIGHTS_EDITOR | IS_PAGE_EDITOR
   ^= IS_USER_RIGHTS_EDITOR + IS_PAGE_EDITOR

  Is a value set? (p.e. IS_USER)
    (to_check & IS_USER == IS_USER)
