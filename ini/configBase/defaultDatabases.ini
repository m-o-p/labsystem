;; The DATABASES *****************************************************************************
;; WORKING DATABASE
; In this database all data related to the current running environment ( user's rights, 
; points, answers, schedules etc.) are stored. This database will probably change each term
; since you will have new user and new answers and so on.
; The data database might stay the same if you don't plan to make major changes to its content.
; If you plan so, you should also change it (p.e. by copying it), because the data are also the
; data for former memers (if they can still log in) and so they might get confused by the changed
; data base...
  WorkingDatabaseName       = "labsystem_demo_working_database"
  WorkingDatabaseHost       = "localhost"
  WorkingDatabaseUserName   = "root"
  WorkingDatabasePassWord   = ""

;; DATA DATABASE
; In this database all the web pages, all the lab questions and all the lab exercises are stored.
; If you make the config for a new term, you might leave this unchanged, if you don't profoundly
; change the contents.

;; AUTHENTICATION
; User database for authentication.
; Only used by ../php/authenticate.php
; If you use other authentication methods, you don't need this section.
; A user that got authenticated has the DefaultAuthUserRights specified below if you don't change that.

    ; The following field will be used as relation between the user database and the systems database for the rights.
    ; The user might change all of his settings but this key must remain unique and identifying!
    UserDBField_uid       = "uid" ; I use an md5 over some fields...
