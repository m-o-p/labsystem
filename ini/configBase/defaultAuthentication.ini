; The following course identifier is used to qualify the users that belong to this course.

;; Rights management *************************************************************************
; After installing there will be no user rights set.
; To do that you need to be an user rights sdministrator.
; The following user will always be one:
  RightsAdminUsername   = "mop" 

; This user can add other admin users etc. so you only need that account for setup.
; As long as this is not set to "" this user will always be user rights administrator.

; The following field specifies which rights logged in users have that are not specified otherwise.
  DefaultAuthUserRights     = "49" ; IS_USER+IS_ROUNDMAIL_RECEIVER+IS_ALL_MAILER
                                   ; See ../include/user_roles.inc for possible values (add all those you want).
