This document describes how to set the demo functionality up
as done on http://demo.labsystem.m-o-p.de/

THIS IS NOT RELEVANT FOR NORMAL USE OF THE SYSTEM.


For the demo logins we use one data database and multiple working
data bases (for each demo account one).

The data database must only be accessable for read not for write
as we do not want the demo users to alter the content.

The working databases contain the inputs of the users. This should
be testable by the demo users.

As data database we will just use the one that is already contained in
the installation.

1) Copy the 'config_demo.ini' to
   a. config_demo1.ini
   b. config_demo2.ini
   c. config_demo3.ini
   d. config_demo4.ini
   e. config_demo5.ini

2) Set the working database in each of the copied files above to
   another one AND REAAD 3) before.

   For instance:
   In 'config_demo1.ini' do
	'WorkingDatabaseName       = "labsystem_demo_working_database"'
	=> 'WorkingDatabaseName       = "labsystem_demo_working_database1"'

   In 'config_demo2.ini' do
	'WorkingDatabaseName       = "labsystem_demo_working_database"'
	=> 'WorkingDatabaseName       = "labsystem_demo_working_database2"'

   ...

3) Change the user of the DataDatabase in the configurations demo[1..5] to
   one that has only READ access in order not to make the demo users alter 
   the non reverted content.

4) Run http://[url of your copy]/setup/?config=demo1
       http://[url of your copy]/setup/?config=demo2
       http://[url of your copy]/setup/?config=demo3
       http://[url of your copy]/setup/?config=demo4
       http://[url of your copy]/setup/?config=demo5

5) Create the spinning counter as described in index_demo.php

6) Now the demo login should be possible via calling
   user perspective:	http://[url of your copy]/index_demo.php?userrole=user
   corrector persp.:	http://[url of your copy]/index_demo.php?userrole=corrector
   all perspective:	http://[url of your copy]/index_demo.php?userrole=all

7) Done. Have fun ;)
