;; this file contains the main Menu entries
; BNF of entry row:
;    [entryRow] = "[" TITLE "]" |
;                 SECTION_UNIQUE_NAME "=" """ {LINK} {"!" RESTRICTION} """ |
;                 SECTION_UNIQUE_NAME "=" """ "!" SHORTCUT """
;
; LINK example:     "http://www.google.de"          ; external link
;                   "../pages/view.php?address=p3"  ; not restricted (always visible) internal link
;                   "../pages/mailForm.php!1"       ; restricted (only visible) for IS_USER
; SHORTCUT example: "!p1"                           ; shortcut to p1 shown if p1 is visible
;
;  [title]                                      ;; the title of the section
;  menuPoint1      = "index.php?foo=bar&nomenu" ;; the first entry
;  menuPoint2      = "index.php!1"              ;; visible only for IS_USER (logged in)
;  spacer1         = ""
;
; A section is only shown if at least one element inside is visible.
;
;; If you provide a relative link (without "http://") the SessionID
;; stuff and other header stuff is added automagically
;
;; Inside one section you can have each entry on the left ONLY ONCE!
;; Since the file is parsed by the parse_ini_file( "../ini/mainMenu.ini", TRUE );
;; function, some characters are forbidden on the left (like "!").

;; There is one predefined menu element: (you can also add elements to that section)
; [sys_login]   will be replaced by a title bar containing the user name and
;               next the login/ logout button, rights, and statistics.
;               The rest of the section will be added below.

; [accessible_labs] Lists the system's title and all labs that are accessible via schedule
;                   (so all labs that are visibl before their first schedule and those running).
;                   The order is the one of the first schedules per lab
;                   (so first scheduled one is topmost after the always visible ones).

; [edit_menu] Contains everything for editors:
;             - elements (to manage elements)
;             - edit CSS to edit the user stylesheet
;             - edit menu to edit this menu
;             - import | export to import and export modules

; You can specify that menu entries appear only for special users.
; [menu entry] = "[linkto][!][restriction]"
; The retriction must be a numerical value (addition of user_roles that have to be set)
; p.e.: user rights     = "../pages/userRights.php!128"; 128 ^= IS_CORRECTOR
;
; Restrictions: (visible on the labsystem's "my rights" page)
; ---------------------------------------------------------------
;    1 | someone who authenticated
;    2 | is able to set the user rights

; You can link directly to elements by using ![elements address] p.e. !p1
; The menu entry will be shown if the element is visible.

; Examples:
; [Title1]
; Label1         = "http://labsystem.m-o-p.de"     ; external link to the labsystem's home
; Label2         = "../pages/view.php?address=p1"  ; internal link (session stuff etc. will be added) to element p1
; Label 3	 = "!l1"			   ; internal shortcut link
